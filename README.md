E-COMMERCE WEBSITE
Many fans of celebrities admire their sense of style and aspire to wear the same clothes and accessories their idols showcase in public appearances, 
photoshoots, or on social media. However, these items are often out of reach for the average consumer due to their high prices and exclusivity. 
Luxury brands frequently collaborate with celebrities, resulting in unique or limited-edition items that quickly sell out or are not widely available. 
Additionally, some pieces worn by celebrities are custom-made, further limiting access to the general public. 
These challenges leave fans feeling disappointed and unable to replicate the style of their favourite icons.
Another factor complicating this is that celebrities rarely wear the same outfit more than once, adhering to the unspoken rules of the fashion and entertainment industries. 
As a result, many of these high-end outfits end up sitting unused in their closets. At the same time, fans continue to seek out affordable ways to own similar pieces or authentic items that hold a connection to the celebrity they admire.
This creates a significant gap between demand and accessibility in the world of celebrity fashion.
To address this issue, we are developing an innovative platform that bridges the gap between fans and celebrity wardrobes.
This website will allow celebrities to resell outfits and accessories they no longer wish to keep. 
The items will be offered at discounted prices, making them accessible to a broader audience, including fans who may not typically afford high-end or exclusive fashion. Through this platform, 
we aim to democratize access to celebrity fashion while promoting sustainability in the fashion industry.
